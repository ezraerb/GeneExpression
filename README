This file describes GeneExpression, a program for plotting genes grouped by corrolation, the similiarity of expression behavior. It plots both a corrollogram and a dendrogram tree of the gene groupings

This program clusters genes based on similarity of expression patterns. The 
result is output by both a dendrogram tree and a corrolations matrix. It uses 
relative changes in expression levels for the clustering so large absolute 
values do not skew the results. The clustering itself is done by average link 
clustering on the Euler difference of the expression values. 

The input file must consist only of gene names and expression values, seperated
by spaces or line ends. Genes with missing expression values are flagged and 
will cause the file to be rejected. Duplicate gene names will cause the
clustering to fail. Genes whose expression values do not vary beyond the error
tolerance will be filtered out of the results.

The correlogram is output as a heat map, with brighter color meaning higher 
corrolation value (and a lower Euler distance). Genes groups with the highest
corrolation, as given by the dendrogram, are given the same color in the 
output.

Installation instructions:
1. Create a directory.
2. Create the subdirectory 'data'
3. Download files to the directory. 
4. Compile files with 'javac GeneExpression.java'
5. Place gene data to cluster in the data directory.
6. Run the program as 'java GeneExpression [file name to process]'
